# DSA (Data Structures and Algoritms) with C++

<p>C++: C++ is a high-performance, object-oriented programming language that is commonly used for building operating systems, games, and other performance-critical applications. It has strong support for data structures and algorithms, and its performance and control over memory management make it a popular choice for competitive programming and algorithm competitions</p>

# Overview

Data Structure is a systematic way to organize data in order to use it efficiently. Following terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.

- [ ] Interface ->Each data structure has an interface. Interface    represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.
- [ ] Implementation −>Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.

## Characteristics of a Data Structure
- [ ] Correctness − Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.
